Aurora Music is built for a modern, fluent experience of listening music on Windows 10. It is MIT Licensed, you can fork it and build your own personalized music players.

Meanwhile, Aurora Music is extensible, we've preserved interface for lyrics, metadatas and online musics. Building your extension can extend the ability of Aurora Music. We're also planning to support more advanced extensibility, such as audio effects, UI layouts, etc. Please see [Road Map](https://github.com/pkzxs/Aurora.Music/blob/master/README.md#road-map)
